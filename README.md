Gokit example integrated with consul

# Run Consul
For development purpose, consul is executed via docker

    docker run --rm -p 8400:8400 -p 8500:8500 -p 8600:53/udp -h node1 progrium/consul -server -bootstrap -ui-dir /ui -advertise 10.71.8.125

# Register Service to consul

    go run src/github.com/ru-rocker/hello/hello.d/main.go

# Discover or subscribe from consul

    go run src/github.com/ru-rocker/hello/discover.d/main.go

# File structure
* `service.go` : service / business logic
* `transport.go` : make endpoints and json encode/decode
* `discovery.go` : register service to consul.

## Notes:
For this example, there are two endpoints. First one is hello endpoint, for saying hello.
The other one is health endpoint. This endpoint is intended for consul health checks.
